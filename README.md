## Glad to see you here!

I'm a software and machine learning engineer who mostly specializes in web development. I love programming, reading and cats, of course. <br><br>
Currently I study in Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technologies and pursuing a Computer Science degree in Software Engineering. If you want to contact me, I'm always happy to respond, either on my social media or just by email.<br><br>
On my repositories I usually post my school and personal projects, if you find some helpful materials on studyings, don't forget to star repo or just message me :)
